== What is a Design Pattern?

**Design Pattern** is a solution to a specific problem, a set of programming experiences summarized to solve recurring problems.

Design patterns first appeared in architecture. In 1977, Christopher Alexander proposed this concept in his book "A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction".

=== Gang of Four (GoF)

In 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides co-authored the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". These four authors are known as the Gang of Four (GoF). The book includes **23** design patterns, known as GoF design patterns.

== Advantages of Design Patterns

- Familiarity with design patterns allows you to understand framework code more quickly.
- Enhances the reusability, scalability, and maintainability of your code.
- Makes it easier to discuss abstract concepts with other engineers.

== When Not to Use Design Patterns

If your requirements are simple and can be accomplished with straightforward algorithms, do not use design patterns to avoid increasing the complexity of your code.

== Classification of Design Patterns

=== Purpose

Design patterns can be classified by their **purpose** (the use of the pattern):

. Creational: Object creation processes.
. Structural: Composition of classes or objects.
. Behavioral: Interaction and responsibility distribution among classes or objects.

=== Scope

Design patterns can also be classified by their **scope**, indicating whether the pattern is primarily used on **classes** or **objects**.

== Overview of 23 Design Patterns

=== Abstract Factory

Provides an interface to create a family of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

=== Adapter

Converts the interface of a class into another interface expected by clients, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.

=== Bridge

Separates the abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.

=== Builder

Extracts the construction process of a complex object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.

=== Chain of Responsibility

Gives multiple objects a chance to handle a request, reducing the coupling between the sender and receiver of the request. The objects are chained together, and the request is passed along the chain until it is handled.

=== Command

Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.

=== Composite

Organizes objects into a tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

=== Decorator

Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object without modifying its structure, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

=== Facade

Defines a high-level interface that makes a subsystem easier to use by providing a unified interface to a set of interfaces in the subsystem.

=== Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

=== Flyweight

Uses sharing to support a large number of fine-grained objects efficiently.

=== Interpreter

Defines a grammar for a language and an interpreter that uses the grammar to interpret sentences in the language.

=== Iterator

Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

=== Mediator

Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

=== Memento

Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

=== Observer

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

=== Prototype

Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

=== Proxy

Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

=== Singleton

Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

=== State

Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

=== Strategy

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

=== Template Method

Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

=== Visitor

Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
