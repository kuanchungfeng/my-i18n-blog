== Preface

Before learning design patterns, it is best to have a certain understanding of **OO (Object-Oriented)** related knowledge, so that you can quickly understand the operation mechanism of each design pattern. The following diagram is a map of background knowledge for design patterns:

=== Three Major Characteristics of Object-Oriented

The three major characteristics of object-oriented (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism) are the core of object-oriented, and almost every design pattern uses object-oriented characteristics.

==== Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to create classes based on **other** classes, avoiding repetitive and recurring code. The time to use **inheritance** is when the **behavior** of one object is similar to the **behavior** of another object, not just because the IS-A relationship is established.

==== Encapsulation

Encapsulation hides the implementation of a class, making it easy to use and change. Encapsulation allows a class to provide services to its users in a **black box** manner, but does not open the code for users to change or use it incorrectly. Encapsulation is a key technology for following OCP.

==== Polymorphism

Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance. When a class inherits another class, polymorphism allows the subclass to replace the parent class. Polymorphism allows different objects to execute the same method, but through their own implementation code.

== Object-Oriented Design Principles

Object-oriented principles are tools or techniques that can be applied to design or write code, making the code more maintainable, flexible, or extensible.

=== SOLID

**Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** proposed in 2009 to classify five object-oriented design principles into SOLID.

==== Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Every object in the system should have a single responsibility, and all object services should focus on achieving a single responsibility.

==== Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

==== Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be able to replace their base types.

- Inheritance must ensure that the characteristics (attributes and methods) of the parent type still hold for the subtype.

- A reasonable inheritance relationship is established when the subclass can replace the parent class.

==== Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Split overly large interfaces into smaller and more specific ones. Clients should not be forced to implement methods they do not use.

- The purpose is to decouple.

==== Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

=== Law of Demeter (LoD)

If two classes do not need to communicate directly, then they should not have direct interaction. If one class needs to call a method of another class, it can be forwarded through a third party.

- Emphasizes that 'in the design structure of the class, each class should minimize the permissions of its members.'

- Also known as the principle of least knowledge.

=== Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation

Programming should be done to the supertype. This is the plain language meaning of the dependency inversion principle mentioned above.

=== Favor Object Composition Over Class Inheritance

Using composition is much more flexible than inheritance. It allows you to encapsulate algorithms into classes and 'dynamically change behavior at runtime.'

=== UML

UML (Unified Modeling Language) describes the class collection of the system, the attributes of the classes, and the relationships between the classes.

==== Class Diagram

A class diagram allows you to see at a glance what the class is called, what attributes and methods it has, and clearly express what the class is supposed to do.

==== Associations in Class Diagrams

Associations between classes allow you to see at a glance the reference relationships between two classes (objects).

=== Three Alternatives to Inheritance

==== Inheritance vs. Composition

**Composition** allows you to use behaviors from 'a group of other classes' and switch those behaviors at runtime.

==== Inheritance vs. Delegation

**Delegation** is the responsibility of delegating specific work to another class or method.

==== Inheritance vs. Generics

**Generics** allow you to use other types without specifying them explicitly, and bring them into methods or classes as **parameters** when actually used.

== Design Pattern Reading Order

Joshua Kerievsky hosted a design pattern reading group for about three years and proposed a reading order for design patterns:

Factory Method -> Strategy -> Decorator -> Composite -> Iterator -> Template Method -> Abstract Factory -> Builder -> Singleton -> Proxy -> Adapter -> Bridge -> Mediator -> Observer -> Chain of Responsibility -> Memento -> Command -> Prototype -> State -> Visitor -> Flyweight -> Interpreter -> Facade

== Eight Common Design Patterns

If you think of 23 design patterns at once and want to give up, you can start with the simplest and most common eight design patterns:

. Abstract Factory

. Adapter

. Composite

. Decorator

. Factory Method

. Observer

. Strategy

. Template Method

== Design Pattern Learning Resources (Books)

There are many websites introducing design patterns on the internet, but they all talk about a certain design pattern individually. If you want to systematically see all the design patterns at once, here are recommended learning resources:

=== Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

- The original GoF design patterns book.

- Detailed introduction to the purpose, motivation, structure, effects, implementation, and related patterns of each design pattern.

- Because it is the original, the reading difficulty is relatively high.

=== Head First Design Patterns

- Uses visual, game-based, and question-based teaching to stimulate brain activity, making you unconsciously remember what you read.

- Because it involves many brain-stimulating activities, the reading time is relatively long.

- After more than 10 years, the second edition was finally released this September.

=== Design Patterns Explained

- Understand the relationship between design patterns and life through the dialogue of two engineers.

- The reading experience is very relaxed, suitable for reading at any time.

=== Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#

- The author of Clean Code (Uncle Bob) uses design patterns to solve problems encountered in practical work.

- The book introduces UML diagrams, design principles, and agile development.

The last one is an online resource that includes all GoF design patterns, making it easy to quickly understand a new design pattern.

=== Refactoring.Guru - Design Patterns

- https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns[Link here]

- Supports multiple languages (both human and programming languages).

- Lists the essence of each design pattern, with relatively short reading time.

== Summary

No matter which way you choose to learn design patterns, the most important thing is to **write code yourself**. Only by writing it once will you know how the design pattern works.
